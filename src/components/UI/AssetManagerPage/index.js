            Oversight and maintenance: the Asset Manager is in charge of overseeing the asset 
            and ensuring it functions properly. This may include security, repairs, marketing, 
            or replenishing funds in the case of a Crypto ATM.

                Since profits are based on an assetâ€™s revenue rather than a fixed amount,

            Asset managers can put down collateral by locking their MyBit Tokens (MYB).

        <p className="Slider__paragraph--last-slide">
            When this occurs, the tokens are burnt and a new Asset Manager is sought. Alternatively, 
            if an Asset Manager performs their duties, they can withdraw their collateral (MYB) in
                increments as the asset generates revenue. This model encourages Asset Managers to act in 
                the best interest of investors or risk loosing financially.
