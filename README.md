### Environment Variables

### Contexts
The application is built around a series of Contexts (See [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)) in conjunction with [HOCs](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) to provide different data to different components across the appliacation.

The following Contexts are available: 

- MetamaskChecker
- Blockchain
- AIrtable
- TokenPrices

So if you need any of the information inside these contexts you can use the `with` high order component each of them provides.
